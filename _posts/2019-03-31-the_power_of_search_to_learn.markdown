> I am here to become a programmer/developer/engineer/what else?  How do I do this from scratch?  I would probably start out with an internet search along the lines of "How do I..."  I am finding that programming, regardless of language, starts the same way.  I am doing my best to pseudo code on paper before attempting to create actual code.  However, this sometimes proves a daunting task because I am unsure how to formulate my thoughts in a way designed to, in essence, teach a "dumb" machine to do something.  All these many years, I thought the computer was the smart one--I am seeing I am incorrect.  ME!!  The computer needs ME to tell it what to do.  Mind blowing!  The computer will only react 100% correctly if I tell it how to react 100% correctly.  In other words, how do I find the right code in the right order and right syntax?  How do I make the lines of characters create the result?  I start with the pseudo code, see what I can parse from the lesson plans, **and internet search the rest**.  If I get stuck in any one place, I can search for a way out.  I am not here to reinvent the wheel...I am here to make more wheels, efficiently, quickly, and in the same way they have always been made (but I can't always remember how).

> Schooling for me (pre-tech boom) involved lesson plans built around endless memorization.  Flash cards and notebooks of the same info over and over again.  Whenever I approach a learning experience, my first instinct is to buy some flash cards and markers.  I resisted that urge this time around.  Why?  I resisted because I took the time to see the amount of resources I have around me to accomplish the tasks at hand.  The Slack community, my fellow, BRILLIANT, cohort students, the Flatiron staff--AND--The World Wide Web!!  The languages have so many nuances that memorization would prove to be more confusing in the long run.  I need to remember the words of the great **Albert Einstein:
**
**Never memorize something that you can look up**

Thanks much--Albert!!
