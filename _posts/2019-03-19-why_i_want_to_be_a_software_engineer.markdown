I have always been fascinated with the computer.  I remember taking AP Comp Science in high school--wayyyyy back in the day (not dating myself).  For me it did not stick though--life happens.  Fast forward to years later and I am now looking into the future and hoping for a job with major relevancy.  I am the type of person that does not dream of retirement.  i want to be able to work until the very end.  Not many jobs can be done into later age in life on a consistent basis.  But--(I hope you can all keep a secret)--Shhh.  **In terms of age--90 is the new 30!**  I hope that my engineering path will allow me to continue to learn and evolve.  I hope to land with a company i can grow with--New friends (let's make that "family").
