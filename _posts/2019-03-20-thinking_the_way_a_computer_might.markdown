 I am trying very hard to think like a computer.  For me, making a peanut butter sandwich is almost without thought of movement.  I open the fridge, take out the peanut butter, open the jar, take out the bread--etc. (I think you get the point.) . In programming, it is not so simple for me to not think it through.  The computer may need to know what a "fridge" is--where the "fridge" is--Geez--maybe even where the handle to open said "fridge" is.  Do not even get me started on which bread--which side of the bread... My point (and I am trying to get there) is that I want to be able to understand why I am coding the way I do.  Why do I need to put a certain method, or iterate over an array? My brain needs to become more algorithmic in thinking.  My biggest fear is that I will not totally understand a program after numerous attempts.   I can be a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to learning and/or applying the learning.  Hey?  I guess in that way, I am like the computer.  The computer will generate error after error until the code makes it run properly.  I guess I may be closer than I thought.
