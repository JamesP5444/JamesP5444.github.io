I am recovering from a stomach flu and trying to complete my project.  Life is fun sometimes.  My biggest issue for this project, besides finding strength to complete it, was trying to pick a website for scraping.  I originally had an idea for an art based project but found that to be just too difficult (at this stage) to get up and running.  While laying in bed with the room spinning (ugh) it came to me...My one true love---Caffeine--Coffee specifically.  It should be a simple enough scrape to have different coffee brands, prices etc.  It turns out that nothing is simple.  The scraping part of the project does not come naturally to me.  I like the challenge of learning new material and a whole new way of thinking about the internet and information itself.  My program needs a lot of work and I do not even know where to actually begin to make it work perfectly--That is why i am glad that my cohort and cohort lead can help me through it.  I might head back to bed now and rest.
